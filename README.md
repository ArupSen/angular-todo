============

The hello world for frameworks is to create a to do list app. There are many ways to build a simple to do list app using some of the more popular js frameworks such as backbone.js or ember.js. This one in with angualar.js. The layout is done using bootstrap 3.2 and font-awesome 4.0.3. Quite a nice way to break into this world.
